# Graph_Algorithms
This repository contains these Graph algorithms in main file:
-> BFS (Walk through the graph by layers)
-> DFS (Walk through the graph as deep as possible)
-> Kosaraju (Find Strongly Connected Components)
-> OrdenaÃ§Ã£o Topologica (This is a custom DFS algorithm that can verify whether a graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) or find its topological order)
-> 2-Satisfability Solver (Find or check if there is a solution for expressions like S = (x+y)(!z+x)(!y+z))
-> Dijkstra (Find the Shortest Path from a node to all other nodes)
-> Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Find the Shortest Path from a node to all other nodes but the graph may contains negative edges)
-> Prim (Spanning Tree)
-> Kruskal
